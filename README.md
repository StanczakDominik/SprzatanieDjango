# djangosprzatanie

A simple Django application tracking "habits" or activities in a shared context. The original use case  is us trying to share housekeeping tasks equally while also remembering stuff that's more rare.

Name is very WIP!

I was able to deploy this on `pythonanywhere` and run it without issues. Tutorial TODO.

# Features

- add and execute tasks that need doing periodically
- use Django account system to log who's doing what
- planned: statistics, who's doing what, where could you help more
- keep notes on more difficult tasks
